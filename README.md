# AdvancedMachineLearning_Course
Projects for this class, part of Data Science masters at ITAM

There are two main projects:

## Windy Gridworld
An agent learns how to navigate in a grid, but the wind won't always let him move where he wants to


## Beerhouse
I will be playing around with an agent, see if he can learn something about beer selling.
